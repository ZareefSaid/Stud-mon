# ***Studemon: Bringing Learning to Students Instead of Students to Learning***

## Inspiration
I've always enjoyed playing Pokemon and I wanted a fun way for my friends and I to study. I then realized that I spend a lot of time on discord. I noticed that it would be convenient for me to be able to study in the same place that I talked to my friends and played games. This is when I formulated the idea of a Pokemon like battle that incorporated studying all in the form of a discord bot.

## What it does
The Studémon bot has many different commands to help with learning. The start command starts a game and gives you the ability to use the punch, kick, and heal commands. These commands help you deal damage to an enemy after answering a question. If you answer the question incorrectly you lose one health point. If you answer correctly you take health points from the enemy. The punch command does 1 damage and is very accurate. The kick command does 3 damage but can miss often. There is also a run command which ends the game. Users also have the ability to add their own questions to help them prepare and study. Please watch the video to get a demonstration.

I also made an associated website and discord server. From the website you can access the bot invite link and the link to the discord server. The website also includes additional resources to help individuals study. The aim of the discord server is to allow people to study together and to ask questions about how to use the bot.
## How we built it
To create the discord bot, the discord.py API was used along with repl.it. I also used a pandas dataframe to add questions and answers. Another thing I used was uptime robot, I used this to host my bot all the time, this means it will never go offline. 

To create the website I used a bootstraps template and edited the html and css to my liking.

Please see the GitHub repository for more.
## Challenges we ran into
When creating the discord bot, I had trouble getting the pandas dataframe to work. I was struggling to write the dataframe as a json file and also had trouble adding and removing questions and answers.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of being able to create a website and a discord bot in such a short amount of time. I'm happy to see that I was able to merge 3 of my major interests: coding, Pokemon, and studying, into one discord bot that I hope many people can benefit from.
## What we learned
This was my first hackathon and I learned a lot about time management and my capabilities. This was the first time I used the discord.py API in such a large scale and learned many things that I didn't previously know. 
## What's next for Studémon
Although I'm proud of what I accomplished, there are still many features I'd like to add. One of the features I'd like to add is multiplayer, this makes it so many different people can play against eachother and have more fun than if they were playing alone. Another feature I'd like to add is question categories, this would make it so you can study in a specific area instead of something broad like all questions. I would also like to add a leaderboard so people can compete to get higher and higher, this would also give teachers and professionals the ability to see how their students are doing and where they need to help them improve.
